I use pcapy to grab the http package and analyze the packages.Pcapy is a Python extension module that enables software written in Python to access the routines from the pcap packet capture library.You can see the curve if you run the main.py which is in "chat/clinet" because I put the other moudle in my server.I use the google protocol buffer to chat with my server,and pcapy moudlue to grab the IP packages.For some efficiency,i create four processes which detemine your core num to pick and analyze the packages.
